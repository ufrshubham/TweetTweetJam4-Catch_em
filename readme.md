### Gameplay

![GamePlay](Demo.gif)

This project contains source code for a simple 2D game I made for [TweetTweetJam4](https://itch.io/jam/tweettweetjam-4). This jam was a theme free with two rules:

1. Your final game code must be 560 characters or less. This includes spaces and brackets, but doesn't include the code composing your framework or engine.
2. No spritesheets or external art libraries allowed! All of your game art must fit into your code. Symbols such as 웃 and ★ are acceptable, as long as they work in your editor and can be included in a tweet!

Made using [Godot 3.2.1](https://godotengine.org/)
